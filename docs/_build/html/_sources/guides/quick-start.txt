==================
Quick Start
==================

This quick start guide provides an overview of how to use DataSync to
sync a local CSV with a dataset.

**NOTICE:** The steps in this guide will replace the entire contents of
the dataset with the contents of the CSV. For a more in depth guide of
using DataSync, including information on how to use DataSync to update
and append information to a dataset, please see `setting up a standard
job <setup-standard-job.html>`__.

Step 1: Download DataSync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to the DataSync `download
page <https://github.com/socrata/datasync/releases>`__, and download the
latest version.

Step 2: Launching DataSync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launch DataSync navigating to the folder containing the Datasync JAR
file that you downloaded previously and either double-click the jar or
run the following command:

::

    java -jar <DATASYNC_JAR>

Step 3: Enter authentication details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter your authentication details (domain, username, password, and app
token) at the bottom left of DataSync. The domain is the root domain of
your data site and must begin with https:// (i.e.
https://opendata.socrata.com). The username and password are those of a
Socrata account that has a Publisher role. Enter your App token. If you
do not yet have an app token, please see `how to obtain an App
token <http://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html>`__. The username,
password and application token will be saved as part of the job
configuration. We recommend creating a dedicated Socrata account (with a
Publisher role or Owner permissions to specific datasets) to use with
DataSync rather than tying DataSync to a particular person’s account.

**NOTICE:** DataSync stores the authentication details unencrypted in
the Registry on Windows platforms (in the following location:
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER) and in analogous locations on Mac and Linux. If you
are concerned about this as a potential security issue you may want to
look into alternative publishing methods. Please contact support if you
have questions.

Step 4: Enter job details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Choose the CSV or TSV File to Publish**

Select the CSV or TSV file on your local machine or networked folder
that you wish to publish by clicking the “Browse...” button and browsing
to find the CSV or TSV file.

**Does the CSV/TSV Have a Header Row ?**

If the CSV contains a header row, keep "File to publish contains header
row" checked. The header row should contain the `API Field
Names <../resources/faq-common-problems#how-do-i-find-the-api-field-names-for-my-columns.html>`__)
of the columns in your dataset. If the CSV does not contain a header
row, uncheck "File to publish contains header row". In this case, the
control file must contain the list of columns, in the order in which
they appear in the CSV.

**Obtain and Enter the Dataset ID ...**

You will need the identifier of the dataset (dataset ID) that you want
to update. To obtain the dataset ID navigate to the dataset in your web
browser and inspect the address bar. The dataset ID can be found at end
of the URL in the form (xxxx-xxxx). For example for the following URL to
a dataset:

https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Fire-911/m985-ywaw

The dataset ID is: m985-ywaw

Enter your dataset's ID into the Dataset ID field.

**Choose the Publish Method ...**

Leave the default option "replace via HTTP" selected This option will:

-  gracefully handles network failures
-  minimizes the amount of data sent by only sending the changes since
   the last update, rather than the complete dataset
-  can reliably handle very large files (1 million+ rows)
-  allows configuration of the way the CSV/TSV file is read and
   processed through the use of a `control
   file <../resources/control-config.html>`__

**Create a control file** A control file is needed to help DataSync
interpret the data within the CSV. In most cases simply clicking the
'Generate/Edit' button to generate a control file with the default
configuration will be sufficient for the job to run successfully.

For more detailed information on establishing configuration in the
Control file refer to `Control file
configuration <../resources/control-config.html>`__.

Step 5: Run the job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the job by clicking the “Run Job Now” button. A loading spinner will
appear as the job runs. The length of the job will depend on the size of
the CSV / TSV uploaded. Once complete, a popup will indicate if the job
was successful or notify you of any errors.

Step 6: Save the job for later use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the job was successful you can save the job to a file on the computer
by clicking “Save Job” and selecting a location to save the file on your
computer (job files are saved as .sij files). When saving your job we
recommend choosing a filename that does not contain spaces (e.g.
'my\_job.sij', do not use a name like 'my job.sij').

After saving the file the '*Command to execute with scheduler*\ ' field
is populated with the command to run the given job. Customers can use
this field to run DataSync from the command line on a scheduled basis.
You can later open a previously saved job by going to File -> Open and
finding the job file you saved previously.

**NOTE:** You should always close DataSync after you are finished.
Failure to do so may cause issues when jobs are run using the scheduler.

To automate updating a dataset you must schedule the DataSync job to run
automatically at a specified interval (i.e once per day). This can be
done with standard tools such as the Windows Task Scheduler or Cron.

`Read the documentation for how to schedule a saved
job <../resources/schedule-job.html>`__.
